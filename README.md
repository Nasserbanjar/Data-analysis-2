## Data Analysis 2 Project  ##
This project demonstrates the application of three core data science techniques: Naive Bayes Classification, Market Basket Analysis, and Sentiment Analysis. Each technique is applied to a specific dataset, with code and reports hosted in the project repository.

1.	Naive Bayes Classifier Objective: 
Objective: We trained the model to predict who would survive based on cabin score.
Dataset: Titanic Dataset

2.	Market Basket Analysis:
Objective: Discovering relationships and patterns between controlled products by analyzing UK transaction data, using techniques such as One-Hot Encoding, the Apriori algorithm, and Association Rules.
Dataset: Online_Retail.csv

3. Text Analysis 
 Objective: The goal of this project is to analyze tweets' sentiments and classify them as positive or negative using natural language processing techniques. The texts were cleaned, tokenized, and lemmatized, then converted into numerical representations. Logistic regression and Naive Bayes classifiers
